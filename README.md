# Exp-1 ATM & BANKING SYSTEM

# AIM:
To develop an ATM and Bank Management System that allows users to securely perform basic banking operations like deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, and fund transfers.

# SRS (Procedure):
A ATM and Banking system UML Diagram represents the design of how different components of a library interact. It typically includes several types of UML diagrams.

i) Usecase Diagram

ii)Class Diagram

iii)Activity Diagram

iv)Communication Diagram

v)Package Diagram

vi)Sequence Diagram
